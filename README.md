Hey all, in order to use the program generate the binary with the given makefile and just type make while you are in the directory.

Then, change the input values of the *** complex singlet dark matter phase *** to the values you want (set a1=0 for our model) and set 
the remaining flags to your choice.

Please feel free to play around with the code and report any bugs or unusual behaviour.

Best Regards,
Felix
